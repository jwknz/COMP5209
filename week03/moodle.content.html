		<p><strong>Rich Pictures</strong> are used to portrait the idea of a product to another person through a story.
So far we have looked at User Flow and User Journeys.
<p>A rich picture is the next step where we take the journeys we have created and illustrate them in a diagram to create a more complete overview of the product.</p>
<p>This also allows us to see whether we have covered all of the bases for the final product.</p>
<p><strong>Human Centre Design</strong> brings in the elements of how we design something. Previously we looked at PACT, this framework allows us to determine what elements are used in various scenarios and if there are any restrictions. HCD is the next step of that in that we gather more information from the users.</p>
<p>We may interview people to gain more insight of what is actually required and what we if what we think the final product should be is clear and simple to use for the end user.</p>
