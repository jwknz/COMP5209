# Work on the scenario in class (Workshop)

There is a file on moodle called memorial park. It more or less mimics the assignment, so that students can practice and work in groups on a similar setup as the assignment.

The scenario explains what needs to be achieved.

Students work on creating the following as explained in class:

* User journeys
* User flows
* Rich picture
* UCD information - create a number of persona's

Discuss at the end of the class the common questions answered like:

* Did it change your perspective on the design process
* Did they underestimate the work that needs to be done before the coding process
