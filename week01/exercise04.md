# Exercise 04 - Research Creation of Webpages

Have a look in the internet what the basic parts are to create a website.
We talked about HTML and CSS and over the coming weeks we will get into more details on those lanuages.

For now look at what you can find and see if you can find any good websites and resources that you want to refer to later.

Write these down in a coding journal so you can easily find them in the future.
