## UX = User Experience

User experience is **everything** related to what the final product is going to be.
When we look at the website we often limit our experience of the website by how it looks.

**UI IS IMPORTANT** and **UI IS PART OF UX**

User Experience goes beyond the design of how we interact with a product. It also looks at why a person would use a product and how the exeperience is for a user with a company beyond the product. The idea is that the product you create reflects what the business is about and "who" the business and its owner is.

> A user's impressions of a website should be the same as if they where to interact with that business in person

## UI = User Interface

User Interface is focused on the looks of a product (app or website) 

UI is part of the UX design and it focuses on the visual appeal of the product. 

** They are not the same **

The video above talked about the term "desire paths", The path people will choose to navigate through your app.

As a UX developer it is your job to make sure you make it as straight forward and easy for people to get to the places you least expect them to go. It is also the important that they can get to and back from the places they navigate to.
