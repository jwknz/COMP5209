# Exercise 1 - Looking at websites (good and bad) (20 minutes)

Find 2 websites and think about the following:

* **Find one website that you like**
* **Find one website that you dislike**

* Why do you like it?
* Is it easy to navigate?
* Is there anything you would improve?
* Is the website responsive? (ie. does it change when the screensize changes)

# Exercise 2 - Difference Between UI and UX (20 Minutes)

Get into groups of 3 and find resources of what the differences are between UI and UX.

* use socialmedia
* find info graphics
* find some jargon around UX and UI and their definitions
* create a digital shared document and share it on the class moodle page when you are finished

# Break - (20 minutes)

# Intro to HTML and CSS (20 minutes)
* Discuss what HTML and CSS are and show examples on websites by viewing the source code. 
* The idea is to see what the students can pick up from the code without being explained what it means. 
* They can draw from previous experience (if any)
* Demo how to setup a project in an IDE and explain what the purpose is of the IDE (and how this work differently from say a bigger IDE like Visual Studio)

# Exercise 3 - Setting up your IDE and installing some extensions (20 minutes)

* The students need to get familiar with the IDE.
* They can choose a theme, look at plugins, learn how install and manage them.
* Learn how to backup your extensions (`.vscode` folder in the Users folder)

# Small Break - (10 minutes)

# Exercise 4 - Research Creation of Webpages (30 minutes)

* Let students explore a few sites (they have to find them) on how to code an HTML page.
* What is required for them to make a webpage
* What are the resources they found (discuss)
* Coding Journal - write down what you find for future references
