# What is the course about

This course is going to take you through the process of web design from client to front-dev. It is focused on UI and UX with some coding in the last 3rd of the paper.

It may seem like a burden not to do coding from the start, but there are some important principles to understand.

* What are the requirements of a client
* How much freedom do we have when it comes to the final product
* What is the process of things before we even start coding (wireframe etc.)

# Assessments

* The assessments run on from one another. However if you fail one, you can get a starter pack for the next assessment.

* Weightings are 30% - 30% - 40%

* Assessments will need to be done with specific tooling (all free)

* If I have to chase you, you will loose marks (if marks are a currency, then they are used to pay your fines)

# Portfolio

Think about creating a portfolio - not marked, but really well worth it.

# If there is time

* Setup Tools (VSCODE, GIT, EXTENSIONS (LIVE-SERVER), FIGMA, DRAW.IO, MS TEAMS, GDRIVE)
