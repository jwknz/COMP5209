# What is the course about (5 minutes)

This course is going to take you through the process of web design from client to front-dev. It is focused on UI and UX with practical lessons in the 3 hour block where we mostly do front-end coding (HTML and CSS)

The first 2 assignments are focused on designing a website and the 3rd assignment is where you will code what you have designed in the first 2 assignments.

As part of this process you will learn:

* What are the requirements of a client
* How much freedom do we have when it comes to the final product
* What is the process of things before we even start coding (wireframe etc.)

# Assessments (10 minutes)

* The assessments run on from one another. However if you fail one, you can get a starter pack for the next assessment.

* Weightings are 30% - 30% - 40%

* Assessments will need to be done with specific tooling (all free) and you will be told about these later on.

* Since all assignments are submitted online via shared documents, code repositories or other tools, it very important to check that your tutor can access the material you submit. If I have to chase you for access to them, you will loose marks.

# Talk about the tools used in this course (20 minutes)

* VSCODE (Visual Studio Code) used for all web development coding
Although you can technically use anything you want, this IDE is now considered industry standard and has a lot of options that you can easily configure.

* Adobe XD (free version) is used to design your wireframes and 

* Figma / Canva these are 2 websites where you can create your moodboards.
We will cover some other tools to help out with these later in the course.

* Git (Version Control) Although not strictly related to UI / UX, it is related to managing your code and is industry standard. In this course we cover how you can take your designs and turn them into code. This code needs to be stored in version control so you can then pass it on to the next department (front-end developer)

* Using your `@g.toiohomai.ac.nz` accounts. As a student you get access to Google for Education accounts. This means you can create and collaborate and sign up for services that require a google account.

If you bring in your own device, all of these tools are free for you to install.

# History of HCI, UI and UX (60 minutes)

Content for this is on moodle. There are 2 sets of slides and a series of 4 videos. 

Make sure you watch video 1 (Ted Talk on Desire paths) and video 3 (Lynda.com - Designing around human limitations)

Students will need to sign up for a Lynda.com account if they have done so already - this can be done on the moodle homepage.

If you don't finish the slides, make sure the students look through them for homework.

# Next Lessons

* Flow charts (week 02)
Next week we will talk about flow charts and sitemaps. This will show us what all the parts are that are needed to make a web page.

* User stories (week 03)
