# Client Interviews

* Watch Video 1

This video is a comedy sketch where product managers are not asking the right questions and expect "Anderson the expert" to be able to do whatever they ask.

This is an example (although a sketch) of a bad meeting as whatever the client asks for is expected to be completed, but in reality it doesn't always work out that way.

* Slides

Set of slides talking about:
* interview
* open and closed questions
* what are bad customers
* open the link to see a lot more than what fits on a slide
* a picture that displays how communication can show the wrong outcome if it is not explained well

* Watch Video 2

This video is about what clients can do to be good clients. It helps if as the interviewer you know what a good client is, so you know what can expect from them.

## Exercise

1. Continue on with the exercise from Memorial Park, as a team create 5 questions that are relevant to the project and interview other people in the class room.

2. Find out who would you need to interview and why?

So now we have covered 3 parts:

* Interviews
* Rich Pictures
* User Journeys + User Flow

Discuss as a class now that you know these parts do you feel and why (you feel this way) that you can prepare a better product then when you just start to code right away.

It should show that students realise that UX is a big part of the whole process.

* if you work as part of a bigger team, it is good to know about the process so you can have good conversations about if you need to

* if you work as part of a small team, you may have to actually do this work since you may have multiple roles as part of your job
