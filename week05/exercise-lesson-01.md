# Exercise

Create a website using the bootstrap framework. Even though we have talked about using a package manager, for the exercise using the CDN links is fine.

Open up your code editor and setup a new project with a single HTML file. Go to [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com) and find the documentation on the following elements:

* jumbotron
* navigation bar
* cards
* grid system
* form
* a table with a weather forecast or some other data. This can be completely fake and does not have to link to anywhere.
* modal pop up

Put these elements on your HTML page and set them up on a page that has a 3 column grid.

You need to show 3 cards next to each other

The form needs to take up 6 columns and have another item next to it taking up the other 6.

The form needs to ask for the following:
Name, Email, Subject, Message

When you click on the submit button, a **modal pop up** should appear

You are free to change the data that comes with the example to what you want it to be.

Save your work and show it to your tutor before you leave the class.

**OPTIONAL EXTENSION**

When you are on your own device or a computer lab (where node.js is installed) setup a website that uses bootstrap with npm.

Getting used to the process is important even if it is only to understand the developer jargon
