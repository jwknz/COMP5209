# COMP.5209

This repository contains all of the content for this course.
In each week there is a `moodle-content.md` file so that the content can be presented in an LMS.

There is some HTML code on those md files for advanced markup purposes.

Using the tool [gh-markdown-html-converter](https://github.com/jwknz/gh-markdown-html-converter) you are able to read the markdown files directly onto a website and use a script tag to display the content.
